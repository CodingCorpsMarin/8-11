Let’s create a HTML form:

First, create a new repo (folder) in your HTML projects directory (folder), make a new page, “index.html” and fill out the skeleton (<html>, <head>, <title>, <body>, etc tags)
Create another page in that some folder called “page2.html”, add a skeleton, and maybe some text that says “success!”

Title your page “Creating HTML Forms”
Make your page display “Creating HTML Forms” as header text

In <p> tags, prompt user to log in.

Make opening and closing <form> tags
Add an <input> tag for username inside your form, make it a text field. 

Create same thing for password, but make the input field a password field

Create a submit button as an input 

Direct the form to page2 through the form action 

Name your username input “username”
Name your password input “password”

Give your form a POST method

Try it out!
