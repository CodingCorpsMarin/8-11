Let’s create our first CSS stylesheet

Add some new info to your zoo, maybe a description for each animal
In the same directory as your zoo, create a file called “style.css”

Link that file to your zoo with a <link> tag. 

Create a rule to make all h1 tags green in your stylesheet with 
h1 { 
color: green;
}

Make the background of your body red

Make all text inside <p> tags Helvetica and italicized with a font size of 24

Add a new div and change the background image to a picture of a crocodile using in-line styling

Add a border around each <li> tag
